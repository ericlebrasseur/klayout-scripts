=============
RBA = Ruby API

There are two style of programming:
-Traditional Ruby Programming
-Macro-based style (since version 0.22)
--Macros = XML files containing Ruby code + info to link them to KLayout (executed at started or set in menus).
--Preferred way of creating application extensions.

**About Macro Development
Since version 0.22, Klayout can read special macro files with the suffix ".lym".
Those files are XML files that store the macro code + additional information (description text, flags...).
Klayout looks for macro in the following places:
-The "macros" folder in the installation path.
-The "macros" folder in KLayout's user specific application folder.
-Add locations by : right-click on the macro tree > add location
Type of files supported by Klayout IDE:
-".lym" : generic Klayout macros.
-".rb" : plain Ruby files.
-".txt"
